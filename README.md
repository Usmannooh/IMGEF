Here's a polished and enhanced version of your **README.md** file for the **IMGEF** GitHub repository:

**IMGEF**
**IMGEF: Integrated Multi-Modal Graph-Enhanced Framework**
**Overview**
IMGEF is an advanced framework designed for generating high-quality radiology reports by integrating multi-modal features through graph-based techniques. This repository provides the implementation for the IMGEF model, which incorporates spatiall-aware graph embeddings, multi-modal attention mechanisms, and fusion techniques to ensure state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

 **Features**
**Graph-Based Representations:** Incorporates clinical, visual, and textual features using graph-based embeddings to capture spatial and semantic relationships.
 **Multi-Modal Attention Fusion:** Efficient fusion of multi-modal data using advanced attention-based mechanisms.
**Optimized for Radiology Reports:** Specifically tailored for radiology report generation tasks, addressing long-term feature dependencies and data imbalance.

 **Requirements**
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the code:

torch==1.11.0+cu111
python==3.7
torchvision==0.8.2
opencv-python==4.4.0.42


Install dependencies using pip:


pip install -r requirements.txt

**Datasets**
IMGEF is evaluated on the publicly available **IU X-Ray** dataset.

### **Dataset Preparation**
1. Download the IU X-Ray dataset from the [official source](https://iuhealth.org/find-medical-services/x-rays).
2. Place the dataset in the following directory structure:
   ```
   data/
   └── iu_xray/
       ├── images/
       ├── reports/
       └── annotations/

**Usage**

 **1. Training the Model**
To train the IMGEF model, execute the following command:

python maintrain.py 


**2. Testing the Model**
To test the trained model on the IU X-ray dataset:

checkpoints/imgef_model.pth


**3. Evaluation**
To evaluate the performance using standard metrics.


**Results**
IMGEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IU X-ray dataset. Detailed results and comparisons are available in our paper.
